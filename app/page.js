          fixed` actually anchors to the viewport. GradientReveal
          applies a `translate3d` to its content frame for the bottom-
          overshoot gradient, which creates a new containing block and
          would otherwise trap any fixed descendant inside it (the nav
          would scroll with the page instead of sticking). It's also a
          sibling of ZoomHero — not nested — so the nav stays visible
          as the user scrolls past the hero. The seam/criss-cross bug
          is avoided a different way now: the Header is *surfaceless*
          (no bg/border/blur) while the hero is on screen, so there is
          no pill layer to overlap with the hero card. The pill only
          materializes once the hero has scrolled past, where it sits
          over NarrativeBlock/ValueProps rather than the hero. See
