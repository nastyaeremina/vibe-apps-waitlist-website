// gains rounded corners — becoming a "card" that sits inside an off-white
// page backdrop. The backdrop is the bg of the wrapper itself, so as the
// hero's visual edges pull inward on scale, the off-white reveals around
// it. No scroll hijacking: we just read `window.scrollY` on scroll and
// apply a transform. Natural scroll continues to move the hero off-screen
// as normal; the zoom is purely additive.
//
// Motion is deliberately small (90% final scale, 28px radius at peak) so
// the page still feels like a page, not a demo reel.
