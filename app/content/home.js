      "Our app builder is the only one that understands your business. Describe what you want, a custom intake flow, a progress tracker, a proposal tool, and it builds an app that works with your existing contacts and companies, respects your permissions, and integrates with email and in-product notifications. Every app deploys straight into your client experience, not as a standalone tool on a separate URL, but as a native part of your firm.",
      "And underneath it all, a real platform. Assembly Studio gives you a CRM for your team, a branded portal for clients, integrated notifications, and permissions, plus a library of reviewed apps you can one-click enable.
